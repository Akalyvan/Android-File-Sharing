The goal of this project is to develop a fast file detection and content detection system for file sharing between mobile devices. The problem is when 2 devices encounter with each other, one need to decide quickly whether the other device has the file it need and furthermore, whether it has the missing content of the file it need.
We use WiFi Direct as the method of connecting devices and create socket once two devices are connected. Then the client and server can communcate and decide what data to transfer. The detection can be done using hash table. We can divide the file into chunks and use hash table to identify the existence of the chunks. If one missing the chunk and the other one has it, then they can transmit the particular chunk. Then the problem seems can be solved by two level of hash table. First level is for file detection and the second one for content discovery.
Another way to do this is to use Bloom Filter which is a revolution over hash table. The main advantage of Bloom Filter is its space saving character. This may be a good idea because the two-level hash table can use a lot of space. But the time efficiency of Bloom Filter compared with hash table is not clear. So maybe we can perform a test and compare them.
